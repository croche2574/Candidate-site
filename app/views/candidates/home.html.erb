                        The energy and resources ready and waiting to support Progressive Democratic candidates 
                        are at an all-time high. The Polk County Progressive Democratic Caucus (PCPDC) Candidate 
                        Assessment and Voter Awareness Initiative was established to provide a reference for declared 
                        Progressives and other Democrats and independents with progressive values to determine where 
                        to focus their energy and resources.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Questionnaires were sent to all candidates who have filed as Democrats for national or state
                        offices that touch on Polk county. A select committee of PCPDC members is in place to apply 
                        predefined criteria in an objective blind evaluation of candidate responses as they are received. 
                        The questionnaires reflect a Progressive Democratic agenda. In fact, the questions were derived 
                        directly from the Democratic Progressive Caucus of Florida’s platform.
                    </p>

                        The evaluation rating indicates each candidate’s level of support for the progressive agenda. 
                        In accordance with Florida Democratic Party bylaws, these evaluation ratings are not intended 
                        to imply endorsement during this primary season, but rather to inform progressive minded voters
                        within the county of each candidate’s overall alignment with progressive values.
